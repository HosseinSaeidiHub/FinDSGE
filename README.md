# 📈 Economic Simulators in Python (DSGE & Financial Markets)

This project implements dynamic and extensible economic simulation frameworks in Python for:

- 🧮 **DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) modeling**
- 📊 **Agent-based and stochastic simulations for financial markets**

These simulators are designed for economic theory testing, policy analysis, and quantitative finance research. The code is modular, well-documented, and includes calibration tools and visualization utilities for deep economic insight.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Simulating business cycles and monetary policy with DSGE models
- Modeling financial market dynamics using heterogeneous agents
- Analyzing the effect of shocks on inflation, interest rates, and GDP
- Performing sensitivity analysis on structural economic parameters
